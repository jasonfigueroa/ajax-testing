# About This Project

This is a very minimal project that I would like to keep as simple reference for:
1. Modular JavaScript development using Browserify.
2. The database interface module (dbInterface.js) has a basic implementation of AJAX with firebase.

For the data I'm using:
- [https://discounts-cb09b.firebaseio.com/categories.json](https://discounts-cb09b.firebaseio.com/categories.json)
- [https://discounts-cb09b.firebaseio.com/products.json](https://discounts-cb09b.firebaseio.com/products.json)

To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `grunt`
4. run `http-server`

Note: The data.json file in the data directory is just what I uploaded to firebase, it is not currently in use within the project.
